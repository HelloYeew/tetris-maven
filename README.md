# tetris v.updated with no longer monke build

An updated version of my old [tetris](https://github.com/HelloYeew/tetris)

The code has not much changed but this updated to make it can build with Maven, run with new Java and can add a unit test.

Since I make this like a _framework_ so it's easy to customize and test with unit test but the old build system is not easy to add the test, so I moved it to Maven.
